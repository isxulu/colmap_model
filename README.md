# Scripts for COLMAP Sparse/ Dense point clouds.
1. This script is based on a reconstructed sparse/dense comlap model obtained from known camera poses.
2. The script is based on the `seq_02` format, and the `meta_data.json` file should include the `train_list`. If there are any discrepancies in the format, adjustments may be required in the Python scripts within the `utils` folder for data processing.
3. To run the command: `./run.sh (seq)`.
